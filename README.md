# Basic E-Commerce React Application

This project is a basic e-commerce application built with React. It includes product listings, a product detail page, a shopping cart with item quantity management, and global state management using React Context. I developed this application as a learning exercise to understand and apply core React concepts.

## Features

- **Product Listings**: Displays a list of products with images, descriptions, and prices.
- **Product Detail Page**: Provides detailed information on a selected product and an option to add it to the cart.
- **Shopping Cart**: Displays items added to the cart with functionality to update item quantities.
- **Persistent Cart**: Stores cart data in `localStorage` to preserve items across page reloads.
- **Routing**: Implements navigation between pages using `react-router-dom`.
- **Global State Management**: Manages cart state globally using Context API.

## Technologies Used

- **React** (v18.3.12): Front-end framework.
- **React Router**: Manages navigation between pages.
- **Context API**: Handles global cart state.
- **localStorage**: Persists cart data across sessions.
